										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the most powerful graphics card you can buy today, delivering playable 8K gaming performance, along with jaw-dropping 3D rendering and encoding performance. However, you have to pay a high price for this level of power, and it's probably not worth the investment for a vast majority of people.

												<h2 class="review-heading">24GB of GDDR6X</h2>

												<p>
														The RTX 3090 is rocking 24GB of GDDR6X video memory on a 384-bit bus, which makes for 936 GB/s of memory bandwidth – that's nearly a terabyte of data every second. Having such a huge allocation of VRAM that is this fast means that anyone that does heavy 3D rendering work in applications like Davinci Resolve and Blender will get a huge benefit.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Tensor Cores</h2>

												<p>
														The third-generation Tensor Cores present in Nvidia Ampere graphics cards have also seen a massive improvement, doubling in speed over the Turing Tensor Core. However, DLSS performance hasn't seen a 2x performance bump overall, as each SM now packs a single Tensor Core, whereas Turing had two Tensor Cores per SM.

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 still rules the roost, even despite AMD’s efforts to topple it. Nvidia’s newest flagship boasts 24GB of GDDR6X RAM tucked behind that huge heatsink, and it delivers when it comes to hardcore gaming and 3D rendering. In fact, it has since replaced the manufacturer’s two highest performing graphics cards of the previous generation, the Nvidia Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti.

										Even with the newest AAA games, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 delivers amazing 4K performance and can even handle 8K gaming at 60fps, though it’s not quite perfect at that level. So, while its predecessors may have set a high bar to meet, it’s proven to be up to the challenge. In fact, while it can handle the best PC games without breaking a sweat, it’s more attractive to those who need some heavy graphical lifting for 3D animation and video rendering.

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										However, even though this beast has many positives, you don't need to fork out rediculous prices if you are either on any form of budget, playing on any resolution under 4k, or you don't need the very best.

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the fastest graphics card in the world, yes, but it's also extremely expensive. The gains over the RTX 3080 aren't worth the price increase, so only people that want the very best no matter the price need apply here.

										The RTX 3090 is a massively powerful graphics card and you simply won't get what you're paying for unless you're playing games at 4K. 

										If you're fine with solid gaming performance, and you don't want to pay twice the price of the RTX 3080 for 15% added gaming performance, you should probably go for the cheaper card – Nvidia itself called it the flagship, after all.
