								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Ryzen 7 5800X3D is the only 3D V-Cache CPU option that AMD is going to offer, it is explained that 8 cores offer the perfect and most balanced gaming performance so it made the most sense to uplift the Ryzen 7 5800X with 3D V-Cache and offer a product that most mainstream gamers can have access to.
								</p>

								<div class="review-feature mb-60">

												<h2 class="review-heading">Speed</h2>

												<p>
														In terms of specifications, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D will offer 8 cores and 16 threads within a single CCD. It will rock a base clock of 3.4 GHz & a boost clock of 4.5 GHz which is slightly slower than the 4.7 GHz of the Non-3D Ryzen 7 5800X. The CPU will feature a TDP of 105W which is the same as the Ryzen 7 5800X.

												<h2 class="review-heading">96MB L3 Cache</h2>

												<p>
														The main difference between the two chips is the amount of cache. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D will carry 32 MB of L3 cache on-die and 64 MB of cache off-die within the vertical stacks. The CPU will feature a single 3D V-Cache stack that incorporates 64 MB of L3 cache and sits on top of the TSV's already featured on existing Zen 3 CCDs. This will give a total of 96 MB L3 cache directly to the Zen 3 cores.

            <div class="bottom-content mb-60">
								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										AMD has thinned out the Zen 3 CCD and the V-Cache so they have the same Z-height as the current Zen 3 processors rather than varying heights between the cores and the IOD. Since the V-Cach sits on top of the CCD L3 cache, it doesn't affect the heat output of the core and has minimal power up-ticks. It is also explained by AMD that while frequency is important, most games are very latency-sensitive so adding more cache was the most practical choice. Also, the benefits of having the extra cache overweighs the frequency degradation so while that tradeoff had to be made, the chip still has better performance to offer over the standard Ryzen 7 5800X CPU.

										Furthermore, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU will be compatible with a full range of AMD 400 and 500-series motherboards. Each motherboard maker will ship out their respective BIOS to add support to their products prior to launch.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X launched at an MSRP of $449 US but that was back in 2020. Currently, the chip sells for a discounted price between £260 ($350) - £300 ($410) US so AMD could go two routes, either launch the Ryzen 7 5800X3D at the same price as the 5800X at £330 ($449) while giving the latter a price cut or simply offer the 5800X3D as a step up with a price close to £370 ($499). Again, this would be better pricing than the Ryzen 9 5900X and Core i9-12900K if you're solely looking for faster gaming performance but other than that, those two options will be worth better if you plan on using the multi-threading capabilities of the CPU.
