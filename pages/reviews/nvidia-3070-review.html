								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is without a doubt the best graphics card on the market for most people. It delivers performance on par with the RTX 2080 Ti at less than half the price, truly bringing 4K gaming to the mainstream for the first time.

												<h2 class="review-heading">GA104 GPU</h2>

												<p>
														The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is powered by the Ampere GA104 GPU. This GPU has 5,888 CUDA cores spread across 46 Streaming Multiprocessors, based on the same Nvidia Ampere architecture as the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. And, as with those cards, there are a ton of improvements both to raw performance and to power efficiency here that drive this mid-range graphics card to performance levels matched only by the very best graphics card of the last generation.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Power Consumption</h2>

												<p>
														The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is also the only graphics card in the Ampere lineup with a reasonable level of power consumption, with a TGP (total graphics power) rating of 220W, 100W less than the RTX 3080. This means that cooling requirements are going to be a whole lot less intensive than the more powerful Ampere cards, which should be excellent news for folks that don't have a ton of room in their cases for larger graphics cards.

										You can thank the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 for bringing 4K gaming to the mainstream the way the GeForce GTX 970 did for 1080p gaming back when it was released. 1080p gaming at max settings and high frame rates all of a sudden was available at an affordable price when 2014’s GTX 970 was released, providing stunning performance on games that are still considered graphically intensive such as Batman: Arkham Knight and The Witcher 3. You no longer had to break the bank or make compromises to get quality performance. 

										There are more powerful cards in the RTX 3000 series line, such as the impressively powerful GeForce RTX 3080 or the RTX 3090. But, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is still a mighty performer that almost goes head-to-head with the previous generation’s flagship, the RTX 2080 Ti without costing £1,099 ($1,199). And, that combination of affordable price and high performance makes it the de facto graphics card for most people. 
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 is easily capable of running pretty much any game at 4K without having to compromise on quality settings. Some games like Red Dead Redemption 2 might have you turn down some settings, though. 

										At £469 ($499), we would hesitate to call the RTX 3070 cheap, but compared to the more expensive flagship cards like the RTX 3080, it provides excellent performance for the money. 

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition doesn't pack the same gigantic cooler that the RTX 3080 does, which will make it a much easier fit into smaller PC cases.

										The RTX 3070 Founders Edition still has that obnoxious 12-pin power connector, even with its lower power requirements. If you don't want to wrestle with an adapter, opt for an aftermarket card.
