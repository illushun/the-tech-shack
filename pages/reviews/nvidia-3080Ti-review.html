                <h2 class="review-heading center">GEFORCE RTX 3080 Ti</h2>

								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is an absolute monster of a graphics card, delivering RTX 3090-level gaming performance at a lower price. However, the high starting price may still be a turn off for budget-conscious folks that just want to get some PC gaming in.
								</p>

												<h2 class="review-heading">Fan Configuration</h2>

												<p>
														There are two fans on the RTX 3080 Ti and just like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, there’s one on the front and one on the back. This fan configuration pulls air through the front of the card, it’ll go through the card, and go out through a fan on the back of the card, probably shooting the hot air through the top of your case. 

														It’s an extremely effective method of cooling the RTX 3080 Ti, and even with a peak power consumption of 350W, the RTX 3080 Ti peaks at just 78.9C. That is a lot higher than the RTX 3090’s 72C peak temperature, even though that card has the same level of power consumption.

												<h2 class="review-heading">12GB of GDDR6X</h2>

												<p>
														The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti does have more VRAM, with 12GB of GDDR6X compared to 10GB of the stuff on the 3080, but it’s also on a faster 384-bit memory bus. That means you get 912 GB/s of memory bandwidth on the RTX 3080 Ti compared to the RTX 3080’s 760 GB/s. With faster VRAM, not to mention just more memory, the RTX 3080 Ti should be even more adept at 4K gaming in the future.

								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Just like the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series, the RTX 3080 Ti is built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture, and brings with it the same improvements as the rest of the lineup. There is something new to the table, however. 

										As with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 that launched in March 2021, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has a hardware-based hash rate limiter that should limit the appeal to cryptocurrency miners. We don’t test mining performance at TechRadar, so we can’t speak to how effective this limit actually is. But given that the hash rate limiter on the RTX 3060 was accidentally bypassed by Nvidia’s own driver update, we’ll just have to wait and see how well this actually dissuades miners from buying this graphics card in bulk. 

										Beyond that, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is actually quite a bit beefier than the original RTX 3080, and that largely falls to core count and memory bandwidth. 
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										However, even though this beast has many positives, you don't need to fork out rediculous prices if you are either on any form of budget, playing on any resolution under 4k, or you don't need the very best.

										The RTX 3080 Ti is a massively powerful graphics card and you simply won't get what you're paying for unless you're playing games at 4K. 

										If you're fine with solid gaming performance, and you don't want to pay twice the price of the RTX 3080 for 15% added gaming performance, you should probably go for the cheaper card.
