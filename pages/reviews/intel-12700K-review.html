								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Powered by two new microarchitectures, one designed for maximum performance and one for peak efficiency, Intel’s Alder Lake CPUs have been making some sizable waves in the desktop processor market. Core counts are once again shooting up, and the Core i7-12700K benefits from this and some key architectural improvements to run laps around its "Rocket Lake" predecessor.

										<div class="right">
												<h2 class="review-heading">12 Cores</h2>

												<p>
														The Core i7-12700K encompasses a dozen CPU cores. Most of the chip's performance is derived from eight Hyper-Threaded P-Cores that are built on Intel’s "Golden Cove" architecture. Golden Cove is the direct successor to the "Cypress Cove" architecture found inside of 11th Generation Rocket Lake processors, and it was designed for high performance. Here, these cores are configured with a base clock of 3.6GHz, but they can hit speeds up to 5.0GHz (in isolated cases under Turbo Boost Max 3.0) or 4.9GHz (under regular turbo boost) right out of the box.

												<h2 class="review-heading">25MB L3 Cache</h2>

												<p>
														Along with the cores, the processor also has 25MB of L3 cache baked in for the cores to share. This model also has Intel’s UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics processor (IGP), which means you won’t need to buy a graphics card alongside this CPU in a system, unless you want to play games that aren’t several years old. Intel rates the chip to have a base power of 125 watts, with a maximum turbo power draw of 190 watts.

            <div class="bottom-content mb-60">
								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										One direct impact of Intel introducing high- and low-power core architectures in the same processor is that the company now has a new way to differentiate its range of processors. With Rocket Lake, all of the Core i7 and Core i9 processors were essentially the same thing: eight-core, 16-thread CPUs with the clock speed adjusted accordingly. With Alder Lake, the Core i9-12900K has a more notable advantage over the Core i7-12700K, in that it has four additional cores, a higher clock speed, and an extra 5MB of L3 cache.

										Without a revolutionary improvement in graphics technology or a doubling of resources, Intel remains a clear second to AMD's Ryzen/Radeon G series chips when it comes to IGPs. That said, only a handful of current chips, notably the Ryzen 7 5700G, actually have integrated graphics. Most Ryzen and Athlon CPUs are CPUs only and require a discrete graphics card. And we all know how much of a purchase burden one of those is, these days.

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										It’s no surprise that Intel’s latest Core i7 processor is faster than its 11th Generation predecessor, but the degree to which performance has increased is rather impressive. The boost in overall core count (thanks to the inclusion of the new E-Cores) made a performance jump a near guarantee, just like we saw with 10th Gen "Comet Lake" and 8th Gen "Coffee Lake." But Intel's Core i7-12700K has also made notable improvements to single-threaded performance on a scale not seen over the last few generations.

										Ultimately, whether or not you should buy a Core i7-12700K depends on your budget and system needs. It’s not quite as powerful as the Core i9-12900K for CPU-intensive tasks, and its performance gains aren’t substantial enough purely for gaming to recommend it over the Core i5-12600K. Opting for the Core i5 likely makes more sense for PC gamers, as this will save them a little cash to put into a graphics card...and the way prices on those have been inflated over the last two years, they are going to need it. Like we said in our first two Alder Lake CPU reviews, though, the lower-end chips like the Core i5 will make a lot more sense once motherboards with lower-end chipsets are available. The Z690 boards on the market now are premium models, and many require DDR5 memory, which is at a premium at the moment. You need to factor in the cost of the rest of the platform in an LGA1700 system build here at the end of 2021.
