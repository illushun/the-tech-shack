								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Ryzen 5 5600X is the most affordable of the Zen 3 family, and comes hot on the heels of our Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X reviews. If there's one serious criticism of AMD's Zen 3 so far it's that the chips are a bit on the pricey side. This is less of a problem at the high-end, where time is money and high performance can claw back time, but as you head down the stack and focus more on gaming, the pay off needs to be more immediate. 
								</p>

										<div class="right">
												<h2 class="review-heading">65W TDP</h2>

												<p>
														The 5600X has a 65W TDP, and limits itself to drawing 76W from the socket. That's impressively low for a modern CPU, and means that there is the potential for some overclocking shenanigans if that's your thing. This is an unlocked chip by the way, although you're going to need a decent cooler to really exploit this fact.

												<h2 class="review-heading">3200 MHz DDR4 RAM</h2>

												<p>
														AMD official supports up to 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, although you'll be able to run much faster memory without issue. The Infinity Fabric runs at 1,800MHz by default, so pairing it with 3,600MHz DDR4 makes sense. There is the potential for a faster Infinity Clock (FCLK) through BIOS updates in the future as well, although AMD isn't guaranteeing this at launch.

										Having looked at the 12-core 5900X and eight-core 5800X, it's a bit of rude awakening to only have access to six cores again. This is still a powerhouse compared to Intel's similarly priced 10600K though, with stronger figures in the X264 video encoding and Cinebench R20 3D rendering benchmarks. In fact the 5600X is closer to Intel's 10700K, which is impressive given that is an eight-core CPU. The Zen architecture really has come on that much.

										If you like to pepper your gaming with more serious work, then something higher up the stack is probably where your money should go. The 5900X is a lot more expensive, but it does offer almost double the performance of this chip in rendering and encoding terms. That is because it is essentially two 5600Xs in one package. 
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is a surprisingly awesome gaming chip. It's not the monster in serious workloads that the more expensive chips are, but then this does only have six cores and 12 threads to play with. It'll still see you fine if you want to dabble in 3D rendering, video encoding, and the like, but if that's your focus, then you're going to have to spend more. 

										It's definitely in gaming where the Ryzen 5 5600X shines. It's comparable to the Ryzen 9 5900X and Ryzen 7 5800X, but it costs significantly less than either of those, rolling in as it does at £220 ($299). This is a chip for anyone that enjoys gaming. It'll trade blows with anything Intel has to offer, and keep your graphics card sated.

										Overall, this is another win for the Zen 3 architecture and for AMD. Sure it's £40 ($50) more than we would have like, but the inclusion of the cooler helps offset this. The more important win is for us gamers: we don't have to pay over the odds for great gaming performance.
