								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is an absolute powerhouse of a graphics card, bringing about one of the largest generational leaps in GPU history. Anyone that's interested in 4K gaming should be paying attention to this graphics card – even if the benefits diminish at lower resolutions.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Fan Configuration</h2>

												<p>
														We were a bit worried when we first saw this fan design that it would affect CPU and RAM temperatures, as it's blowing hot air directly over these components, but even in our personal rig, where we have a Noctua NH-12UA air cooler on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, we didn't observe any difference in performance. We guess it helps that most PC games don't really stress both the GPU and CPU to the same extreme – not yet at least.

												<h2 class="review-heading">CUDA Cores</h2>

												<p>
														Through some clever optimization, Nvidia was able to double the amount of CUDA cores present on each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) by making both data paths on each SM able to handle Floating Point 32 (FP32) workloads – a vast improvement over Turing, where one data path was dedicated entirely to integer workloads. This effectively doubles raw FP32 throughput core for core, though this won't directly translate into double the frame-rate in your favorite PC games – at least, not for many of them.

										The improvements of the RTX 3080 over the cards it’s replaced seems to be the biggest generation leap in power we’ve seen in a long time. It performs 20-30% better than the RTX 2080 Ti and, more impressively, 50-80% better than RTX 2080. What makes this GPU all the more attractive is that performance bump comes with a much more reasonable retail price. It’s almost half the cost of the previous generation GPU.

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 makes high-end gaming much more attainable for the average gamer, running the best PC games with faster refresh rates and higher resolutions for less money. And, if that wasn’t compelling enough, it’s been confirmed that a RTX 3080 12GB version is on the way and its performance and speed is even better than expected. 
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										However, even though this beast has many positives, you don't need to fork out rediculous prices if you are either on any form of budget, playing on any resolution under 4k, or you don't need the very best.

										When Nvidia Turing launched, the RTX 2080 saw a significant price increase over the GTX 1080. And, while Nvidia didn't raise the price, it didn't lower the price back to pre-Turing levels. If you want to get your hands on the RTX 3080, you're going to be paying a high price – even if it is worth it.

										The RTX 3080 is a massively powerful graphics card and you simply won't get what you're paying for unless you're playing games at 4K.
