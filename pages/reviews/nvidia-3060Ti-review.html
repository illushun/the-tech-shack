										For the price, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti punches way above its weight class, providing performance that rivals, and sometimes beats, the RTX 2080 Super. At its price, it’s the best graphics cards for most people.

												<p>
														With this graphics card, you’re getting 8GB of the same GDDR6 memory found in the RTX 3070, paired with 38 Ampere Streaming Multiprocessors (SM). However, because of changes Nvidia has made to its SM since Turing, each of these now has 128 CUDA cores, double that of the 64 in each Turing SM. That means there are now 4,864 CUDA cores in the RTX 3060 Ti, up from the 2,176 found in the RTX 2060 Super.

														The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti also brings a wealth of features to the table too. Esports players are going to love Nvidia Reflex, which aims to cut system latency, RTX IO works alongside Microsoft DirectStorage to load data straight from your system storage to your VRAM and Nvidia Broadcast allows for you to filter out background noise and images while streaming or video chatting, regardless of the software you’re using.

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 still rules the roost, even despite AMD’s efforts to topple it. Nvidia’s newest flagship boasts 24GB of GDDR6X RAM tucked behind that huge heatsink, and it delivers when it comes to hardcore gaming and 3D rendering. In fact, it has since replaced the manufacturer’s two highest performing graphics cards of the previous generation, the Nvidia Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti.

										Even with the newest AAA games, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 delivers amazing 4K performance and can even handle 8K gaming at 60fps, though it’s not quite perfect at that level. So, while its predecessors may have set a high bar to meet, it’s proven to be up to the challenge. In fact, while it can handle the best PC games without breaking a sweat, it’s more attractive to those who need some heavy graphical lifting for 3D animation and video rendering.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is definitely capable of some entry-level 4K gaming, where this graphics card really shines is at the lower 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The RTX 3060 Ti will be able to deliver high-framerate gaming at 1080p for years.

										Because the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is just £299 ($399), you don’t have to worry about emptying your piggy bank just to get the latest graphics card.

										At 1080p, the RTX 3060 Ti is an absolute champion at ray tracing, and you don’t have to worry about unplayable frame rates at 1080p, or really even 1440p with DLSS enabled.

										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti can do a bit of 4K gaming, but if that’s the main resolution you’re going for, you’re better off going for a more capable graphics card, like the RTX 3070 or RTX 3080.
