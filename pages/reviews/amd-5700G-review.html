										As AMD's powerhouse Zen desktop CPU architecture keeps evolving, the rising tide boosting the Ryzen 5000 Series has finally reached AMD's most value-minded CPUs: the Ryzen G Series, equipped with integrated graphics processors (IGPs). Most of AMD's Ryzen processors lack on-chip graphics, a key consideration in these days of wildly inflated video-card prices and campouts to buy a GPU.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Zen 3 Architecture</h2>

												<p>
														The Ryzen 7 5700G is an 8-core, 16-thread processor using AMD’s Zen 3 architecture, clocking up to 4.6 GHz with a 16 MB L3 cache and a 65W TDP. But what makes this chip different to other Ryzen 5000 series parts is the integrated graphics, but sadly it’s not RDNA2 or even RDNA graphics, but rather Vega with 8 compute units clocked up to 2 GHz.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Single Core Performance</h2>

												<p>
														When looking at single core performance, the 5700G is slower than the 5600X, though it's a mere 3% reduction in single thread performance, and when compared to AMD’s previous best desktop APU, the 3400G we’re looking at a 39% increase in single core performance.

										With AMD's Ryzen 5000 Series already impressing us up and down the stack, it's not a shock to see the Ryzen 7 5700G once again resetting our expectations of what a processor in its category can do in 2021. As GPUs remain scarce, your average PC builder might be looking at APUs for the first time in a while. (Indeed, this is the first new Ryzen APU the company has issued for retail sale since the fall of 2019.) And casual esports gamers should seriously consider what they value most in their setups after they get a look at what the 5700G can do in games like Rainbow Six: Siege.

										The eight-core Ryzen 7 5700G can feel excessive at times, but the pricing is reasonable versus other eight-core options. And the stellar performance quickly puts that worry to rest if you are speed-minded. Whether you're building your first gaming PC on a budget that excludes a graphics card, or just need a content-creation engine that cuts out that pesky GPU requirement, AMD's Ryzen 7 5700G easily earns its Editors' Choice award as one of the fastest and most value-conscious IGP-equipped desktop chips on shelves today.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										If you're only running content-creation tasks that don't require a GPU (think video conversion, video editing, rendering tasks, things like that), and you want to spend that GPU money instead on hardware such as more RAM or a more color-accurate 4K monitor, the Ryzen 7 5700G is a solid pick for that niche use case.

										However, if you rely on both a GPU and CPU working in tandem to bring your content to life most effectively, the Editors' Choice-winning Ryzen 7 5800X continues to take on (and slay) all comers in its respective price tier.

										Where the Ryzen 7 5700G rocks: You want to build a powerful PC on the (relative) cheap and want to game exclusively on your IGP? There's no contest to be had: The Intel Core i5-11600K is effectively doubled in frame rate by the Ryzen 7 5700G's IGP, and not just in select instances. The Radeon RX Vega 8 and AMD's speedier memory platform shows its true strength here, pushing both single-player and multiplayer titles better than AMD IGPs of the past.

										The Ryzen 5 5600G has one of those Radeon solutions, though, too, and if saving $100 for near-identical gaming performance is your thing, that chip might be a better alternative for your next build instead.

										Either way, both are stellar new entries in AMD's lineup of dominant desktop chips. The one that's right for you ultimately comes down to what you want to do with your PC the most. Whatever your flavor, AMD's got you covered.
