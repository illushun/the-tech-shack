								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Thanks to its moderately approachable price and excellent improvement in performance over last generation, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is one of the best processors on the market today.

												<h2 class="review-heading">8 Cores</h2>

												<p>
														Each CCX now has 8 cores – that’s up from 4 cores per CCX on Zen 2, greatly reducing latency between cores, and each core has direct access to 32MB of L3 cache, helping improve gaming performance. It’s these improvements in speed and efficiency that give the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X the most meaningful upgrade to gaming CPU performance we've seen in years.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Zen 3 Architecture</h2>

												<p>
														AMD completely redesigned its Zen 3 architecture. So, while it’s still based on the same 7nm manufacturing process as its predecessor, AMD changed the Core Die (CCD) design to only allow for one Core Complex per die.

										The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is £340 ($449), up from the £349 ($399) of the Ryzen 7 3800X. That's the same price increase experienced across the board gen-on-gen with Ryzen 5000, it's just disappointing that pricing saw an increase at all. However it's not hard to see why AMD did this, as Intel doesn't really have anything that can even compete right now. The closest competitor, the Intel Core i7-10700K is £379 ($399), and while we haven't tested that specific processor, we're confident the Ryzen 7 5800X handily beats it across the board.

										At least you won't have to buy a new motherboard. AMD isn't even releasing a new chipset this time around, which means if you already have an X570 Motherboard you already have you already have a compatible board – you just need to update the BIOS.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										If a vast majority of what you're doing with your PC is playing games, this processor will enable the strongest performance, even with the most powerful graphics cards on the market. 

										While the highlight this time around is the increase in single-core performance, multi-core performance also gets a nice boost. With 8 cores and 16 threads 

										However, While the gaming performance increase is enough to justify upgrading to the Ryzen 7 5800X, you won't get the same return for creative applications. 

										The price of the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has Ryzen by around 10%, which means the already high price of this tier of processor is even more expensive. Budget builders are still going to get a lot more mileage out of their money with a Ryzen 3000 processor.
