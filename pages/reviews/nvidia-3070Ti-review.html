								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti delivers some excellent 1440p performance and looks good while doing it. The problem is, though, that every other graphics card can do that right now, meaning there's little reason to pick the RTX 3070 Ti over another GPU.

												<h2 class="review-heading">RTX Broadcast</h2>

												<p>
														RTX Broadcast is a godsend both for streamers and for anyone that has to do a lot of video calls – it filters out background noise from your microphone and headphones, and can even completely replace your background on camera without a green screen. These features work far better than similar solutions built into Zoom or Google Hangouts, too.

												<h2 class="review-heading">RT Cores</h2>

												<p>
														You can't talk about the RTX 3070 Ti without talking about, well, RTX. Just like the rest of the cards of this generation, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti has RT cores, with accelerate ray tracing, making games that support it, well, playable. These days, the amount of games that support the technology is growing, thanks in large part to AMD graphics cards also able to power ray-traced workloads.

										Starting at £529 ($599) – with prices for aftermarket versions likely getting exponentially higher – the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is a full 20% more expensive than the RTX 3070, and you're not even getting that much more performance out of it. In most games, the RTX 3070 Ti is just 5-10% faster, according to our tests, and is absolutely not worth the difference in price. Once the market comes back to normal, there will be no reason to ever buy this card.

										But, right now the market is anything but normal, and our advice is still basically "buy any graphics card you can find at or near MSRP". And at the end of the day, if the RTX 3070 Ti is the graphics card you can find, it still delivers an excellent 1440p gaming experience, and can even stretch its legs into 4K given the opportunity – though this shouldn't be your first choice of a 4K graphics card.

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										At 1440p, the RTX 3070 Ti is faster than the RTX 3070, but not so much that it'll make a huge difference. In Metro Exodus, we're talking the difference between 60 fps and 66 fps. That is a pretty solid 10% jump, but it's not going to exactly be noticeable, and probably isn't worth the 20% price premium you're going to pay. 

										In terms of price difference, the RTX 3080 is just £74 ($100) more, providing you with a massive boost in performance and features.

										While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is faster than the original RTX 3070, it's not enough of a performance boost to be worth the higher price tag. 

										In the past a lot of mid-range cards like the GTX 1070 Ti and RTX 2070 Super only needed a 550W PSU, so you may need to upgrade your power supply for the RTX 3070 Ti, which is quite a chore.
