								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The Core i5 is the CPU that really matters for most gamers. It's cheaper than a Core i7 or Core i9, but it still offers the fundamentals of what makes those chips great for gaming. With the Core i5 12600K, the first Core i5 of the Alder Lake generation, that's no different, although that may be understating its abilities.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Overclocking</h2>

												<p>
														The Core i5 12600K sits just below the 5GHz mark on its P-Cores at stock frequencies, which means you'll have to tweak it yourself to push it over that milestone. That shouldn't be a problem with Intel's promise of overclocking headroom.  Its E-Cores will reach 3.6GHz at their fastest, too. The P-Core base clock is actually higher on this model than the Core i9 12900K, however, at 3.7GHz.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Gaming Performance</h2>

												<p>
														Most impressively is how it dominates the Core i9 11900K in games. The Core i5 12600K is ahead of the Core i9 11900K in every gaming benchmark we've run, and far, far ahead of AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X, which is its all-important competition at this moment.

            <div class="bottom-content mb-60">
								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Also in as much as the Intel Core i5 12600K isn't only a mighty chip on its own, it's the keys to a whole next-gen platform. DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 SSDs are all a little more affordable for the Core i5 12600K's clever balance of price and performance, and that makes the entire 12th Gen platform a little more digestible if you're not prepared to spend thousands of dollars.

										There is still the question of platform costs, which will play into AMD's favour, at least for a little while. So maybe AMD isn't quite shaking at the thought of the Core i5 12600K just yet, especially as AMD should have plenty to come back at Intel with in the new year, by the looks of it.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										There's some glimmer of hope that Intel may be able to deliver enough of this chip for its price to stick around, and that means we might finally have a piece of gaming hardware that actually feels like you're getting a good deal.

										With the state of graphics cards right now, even suggesting that feels wrong. But it's true, the Core i5 12600K is a good deal. With some decently priced Z690 motherboards, it might even be a great deal for a gaming PC build. And that's a PC that can offer high-end frame rates with the right graphics cardâ€”this is a suitably high-end chip masquerading as a mid-range hero, and doing a great job of it.

										Perhaps the Core i5 12600KF is my actual pick for the best CPU for gaming today as it's theoretically going to sit as the cheaper of the two. However, if you do decide to pick up either of the two, presumably whichever you can find for cheaper, you wouldn't be putting a foot wrong.
