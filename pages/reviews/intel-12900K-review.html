										The Intel Core i9-12900K is an outstanding high-end CPU, with Intel offering typically high single-core speeds while also seeing a major boost to multi-threaded workloads to challenge AMD’s Ryzen range. Top it off with superb future-proofing by way of PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, and you have a fantastic chip that offers excellent jack-of-all-trades performance.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Hybrid Design</h2>

												<p>
														This new hybrid design, paired with the intelligence of Intel Thread Director, enables the Intel CPU to assign workloads to the core best suited for the job. Such a design doesn’t necessarily result in more powerful cores, but it certainly makes the chip more efficient – think of it like a well-coached football team.

												<h2 class="review-heading">DDR5 RAM</h2>

												<p>
														The new Alder Lake architecture also enables the i9-12900K chip to support the likes of DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0. The former allows your system to make use of the next generation of RAM, while the latter doubles the bandwidth for the likes of SSDs, which can significantly improve the loading times of a game. Of course, you’ll need to purchase the relevant hardware in order to make use of these new upgrades.

										Intel claims it’s the “world’s best gaming processor”, with the Alder Lake architecture providing a boost to the single-core performance. The number of cores has also been increased to 16, while support for the likes of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 also raise the performance ceiling of your overall rig to dizzying new heights. 

										But the most exciting feature here is arguably the new ‘hybrid architecture’ the chip is built on, with Intel using two different types of cores to make its processors smarter at juggling multiple tasks simultaneously. 

										This is comfortably one of the most exciting desktop processors that Intel has launched for a long, long time. But can its performance justify that lofty price?
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The gains in single-core performance are undeniably impressive, resulting in sizable frame rate boosts for the majority of games I tested. But it’s the improvements to the multi-core performance that impressed the most, with both Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23 seeing results that are almost twice as good as what the i9-11900K offers. 

										This makes the Intel Core i9-12900K one of the most powerful and versatile processors around, despite seeing a very similar peak power draw as its predecessor. 

										The only downside I encountered during testing is that the processor can reach high temperatures under stress. This may mean you’ll need to invest in a more powerful cooler to maximise the performance power of this chip. However, it’s a worthwhile expense for a processor that packs such powerful performance while also being future-proofed for the foreseeable future.
