								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Here comes our second Alder Lake review after looking at the flagship Core i9 on launch date, and this time we’re testing the more mainstream Core i7-12700KF. For those of you wondering, the 12700KF and 12700K are the same CPU with the minor exception of the integrated graphics (Intel UHD 770) which are disabled in the KF version. Besides from that omission, they're exactly the same, although the KF chip will also save you some money.

												<h2 class="review-heading">DDR5 Support</h2>

												<p>
														The stock memory support includes DDR4-3200 or DDR5-4800, and recently we looked at DDR5-6000 performance with the Core i9-12900K and found that for the most part, this new high-speed memory offers very little in the way of extra performance when paired with an Alder Lake CPU. Leading us to conclude that all potential 12th-gen customers should ignore DDR5 and just go with DDR4 for now.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Hybrid Design</h2>

												<p>
														Now, due to the hybrid core design of Alder Lake, the 12700KF along with most of the 12th-gen processors are better of running Windows 11 and its improved thread scheduler for optimal performance. Therefore we’ve tested this and all other CPUs using a fresh install of Windows 11. That also includes Ryzen CPUs, especially after discovering that Ryzen gaming performance is typically a little faster using the more modern operating system.

            <div class="bottom-content mb-60">
								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										The 12700KF was 17% slower than the 12900K, which is a decent margin, and this will be a result of those missing E-cores, along with the smaller L3 cache and slightly lower operating frequencies. But still an incredible result, especially given the 12700KF is a little over 30% cheaper than the 12900KF.

										When it comes to power draw while gaming, we see little difference between the CPUs tested. Whereas the 12700KF pushed total system power usage 31% higher in Blender, here we’re looking at just a 5% increase over the 5800X when playing games. So it'd seem that gamers not need to concern themselves with CPU power draw for now, assuming they're mostly just gaming and not running core heavy applications, though as we’ve seen the 12700KF also does very well there anyway.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										When it comes to gaming, the 5800X and 12700KF are evenly matched, and there’s no true winner. I could see myself happily gaming on either of these CPUs and their supporting platforms. Therefore arguing over which is the best gaming CPU is a complete waste of energy and we’ll leave that to the good men and women of Reddit to work out.

										For everyone else, it’s going to come down to pricing in your region, of both the CPUs and motherboards, and then of course, your use case is also very important. For example, will you be mixing productivity with gaming and if so, does one CPU offer a performance advantage in your particular application? For code compilation work, rendering, or any other CPU intensive task, the Core i7-12700KF is the obvious option and for AMD to turn that around they’ll need to cut prices, and that’s something we can see them doing if there's enough pressure.
