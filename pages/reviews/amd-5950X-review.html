                <h2 class="review-heading center">AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</h2>

								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Here's our first look at the new Ryzen 5000 CPU series, starting with a full review of the Ryzen 9 5950X flagship. As a direct replacement to the R9 3950X, the new chip packs 16 cores with SMT support for 32 threads. The suggested retail price has been increased from £550 ($750) to £600 ($800), so it’s an expensive CPU for the mainstream AM4 platform.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Power Consumption</h2>

												<p>
														We took a quick look at power consumption and we were impressed with what we found. The 5950X is manufactured using the same 7nm process as the 3950X, and yet AMD’s engineers were able to improve performance, but also reduce power consumption for greatly improved efficiency.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Gaming Performance</h2>

												<p>
														Time for the gaming tests where we used the fastest GPU currently available, the GeForce RTX 3090. Starting with Far Cry New Dawn at 1080p, we find a 10% performance uplift for the 5950X over the 3950X. Not a bad result, though that puts the 5950X behind the 10900K by around 6%. They’re identical with the 2080 Ti, but this next-gen GPU pushes performance back in Intel's favor in this title.

            <div class="bottom-content mb-60">

										The 5950X should land at £600 ($800) and that means upon release it will cost £50 ($70) more than the 3950X. In terms of price vs. performance that puts these CPUs on par, both are better value than the 10900K, but slightly worse than other lower core count Intel parts such as the 10600K and 10700K.

										Even if we average the performance seen across the 11 games tested and use that data for a price to performance comparison, we see that while the 5950X beats the 3950X, it’s worse value than everything else. That’s no surprise given games can’t take full advantage of a 16-core/32-thread processor.
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										AMD put Intel in a tough spot a year ago with the Ryzen 9 3950X. It easily beat the Core i9-9900K in core-heavy workloads by packing twice as many cores, and when it came to low-res maximum FPS gaming performance, there often wasn’t that much in it. There were times where the Intel CPU was up to 20% faster however, which is a significant margin and therefore we recommended the 9900K for those seeking maximum gaming performance with little interest in productivity performance.

										Nevertheless, the 16-core 3950X took the mainstream desktop performance crown and also eliminated Intel’s Cascade Lake-X HEDT platform, with the assistance of 2nd and 3rd-gen Threadripper parts. A year later and we have an even better CPU that firmly takes the performance crown away from Intel.

										Of course, if you’re mostly interested in gaming performance, the Ryzen 9 5950X is overkill. You’ll be getting a similar level of performance from the more affordable 5900X and even the 5800X. In most games, even the 5600X won’t be far behind. We'll follow up with detailed reviews on all those chips in the next few days.
