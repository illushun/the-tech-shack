								<p class="review-text mb-60">
										Intel has launched this processor on November 4th 2021 for high rate CPUS and to challenge Ryzen 9 5900x and has a big leap to be strong for this challenge after the big fail of the i9-11900kf which had 10 cores compaired to the Ryzen 9 5900x which had 16 cores, Intel core i9-12900kf is compatible with lga1700 (Alderlake) socket and with z690, h670, b660, h610.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Hybrid Design</h2>

												<p>
														The use of this hybrid design makes some traditional performance measurements difficult to compare. Intel states that individually the performance cores are +19% over 11th Generation, and the efficiency cores are around 10th Generation performance levels at much lower power. At peak performance Intel has showcased in slides that four E-cores will outperform two 6th Generation cores in both performance and power, with the E-core being optimized also for performance per physical unit of silicon. Alternatively, Intel can use all P-cores and all E-cores on a singular task, up to 241W for the Core i9 processor.

												<h2 class="review-heading">PCIe 5.0</h2>

												<p>
														On top of all this, Intel is bringing new technology into the mix with 12th Gen Core. These processors will have PCIe 5.0 support, but also DDR5-4800 and DDR4-3200 support on the memory. This means that Alder Lake motherboards, using the new LGA1700 socket and Z690 chipsets, will be either DDR4 or DDR5 compatible. No motherboard will have slots for both (they’re not interchangeable), but as we are quite early in the DDR5 lifecycle, getting a DDR4 motherboard might be the only way for users to get hold of an Alder Lake system using their current memory. We test both DDR4 and DDR5 later on in the review to see if there is a performance difference.

										From Intel’s perspective, Windows 11 brings the full use of its Thread Director technology online. Normally the easiest way to run software on a CPU is to assume all the cores are the same - the advent of hyperthreading, favoured core, and other similar features meant that add-ins were applied to the operating system to help it work as intended at the hardware level. Hybrid designs add much more complexity, and so Intel built a new technology called Thread Director to handle it. At the base level, TD understands the CPU in terms of performance per core but also efficiency per core, and it can tell P-core from E-core from favoured P-core from a hyperthread. It gathers all this information, and tells the operating system what it knows – which threads need performance, what threads it thinks needs efficiency, and what are the best candidates to move up or down that stack. The operating system is still king, and can choose to ignore what TD suggests, but Windows 11 can take all that data and make decisions depending on what the user is currently focused on, the priority level of those tasks, and additional software hooks from developers regarding priority and latency.

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The Intel Core i9-12900KF is the most powerful chip available when it comes to gaming, while also offering an excellent multi-core performance to challenge AMD’s very best.

										However, The i5-12600KF is arguably the better buy for gaming, offering a similar level of performance while being available at a far more affordable price.

										The i9-12900KF is an outstanding processor, delivering on its promise to become the world’s most powerful consumer chip for gaming, while also seeing a massive boost in multi-threaded performance to finally challenge AMD. If you only need a CPU for gaming, I’d argue that the i5-12600K represents superior value, but this is still a worthwhile chip if you want a high-end processor that can do it all.
