										Intel Core i5-12600KF at 3.6 GHz Top Level processor 12th generation with Alder Lake core name, is working in Desktops with FCLGA1700 socket, released in January 07, 2022. The processor manufactured using 7 nm process technology. Intel Core i5-12600KF has 10 cores and 16 Threads operating at 3.6 GHz (Turbo mode - 4.9 GHz) with typical Thermal Design Power 125 W.

												<h2 class="review-heading">Single Core Boost</h2>

												<p>
														This new ‘hybrid architecture’ is very impressive, but that’s not the only benefit of Alder Lake. It also sees a 19% single-core performance uplift compared to 11th Gen, which will be a big boost for gamers. 
												</p>
										</div>

								<div class="review-feature mb-60">
										<div class="left">
												<h2 class="review-heading">DDR5 Support</h2>

												<p>
														There’s support for DDR5 RAM, raising the performance ceiling significantly for memory. Intel Alder Lake also plays nice with PCIe 5.0, doubling the bandwidth for supported SSDs, which can slash in-game loading times.

										It’s the multi-core performance where the i9 really shines more than the i5, seeing significantly superior results for the Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23 multi-threaded tests. This means that the i9 is arguably the better option for content creation, but the i5-12600KF is hardly a slouch in this department, seeing better scores than both the Intel Core i9-11900K and AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. 

										Intel is heralding the i9-12900K, as the “world’s best gaming processor” but I actually believe the i5-12600KF is the better value option for the majority of gamers after comparing the benchmark results. 
								</p>

                <h2 class="review-heading center">Conclusion</h2>

								<p class="review-text">
										The gaming performance is here is near-enough the best you can expect from a processor. Factor in future-proofed features such as DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 and this chip represents outstanding value.

										However, The Intel Core i5-12600KF isn’t an expensive CPU, but the need for a new motherboard and possibly even DDR5 RAM can drive up the cost. It may be worth investing in a new GPU instead if you just want to improve gaming performance.

										The Intel Core i5-12600KF offers outstanding value, with a similar gaming performance to the i9 and a multi-core performance that can outpace pricier Ryzen chips. What’s more, support for DDR5 and PCIe raises the performance ceiling for your entire system and keeps it futureproofed for years to come.

										Those craving a chip for high-end content creation may be swayed by the i9, while the need to upgrade to a Z690 motherboard may make a new GPU a more cost-effective upgrade for gamers. Yet the Intel Core i5-12600KF remains one of our top recommend desktops processors you can currently buy.
